# Maximum and Minimum Python Program

The program accepts an array of values and then returns n array containing the min and max number, respectively.

For instance, it should return [2, 78] for [4, 66, 6, 44, 7, 78, 8, 68, 2]

It also returns the number of elements in the list in a new list if the `min` and `max` are equal
